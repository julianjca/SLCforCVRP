# Soccer League Competition Algorithm for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
This is a final project on applying Soccer League Algorithm (Moosavian) to CVRP Problem.
The main language that this project use is java.

Solving CVRP can be hard as the problem grows larger so that we need a method that can speed up the process without reducing the accuracy of the solution.
That is the reason why that Metaheuristic Algorithm can be used to solve CVRP with a reasonable time and solution.
